# Warning Order 0001

BPT tie together all information, actions, and resources to create a picture of the battlespace and manuever to defeat the enemy.

# Goal

To provide a framework that gives Executive Leadership "La stratégique" wrt cybersecurity, the art of the commander, to wield and employ appropriately and with adroitness all the means of the Executive Leader in his hand, to move all the parts that are subordinate to him, and to apply them successfully.  This framework needs to be a unified theory, raising tactics to “the science of all times, all places and all arms.” [1].

# Current Condition of Cyber Operations

The vast majority of organizations rely on cyber to conduct operations and store sensitve data, but approach cybersecurity as a burden that they will fully address when the time comes.  This leads to cyber attacks that catch the organization by surprise which delays appropriate responses that have not been rehearsed and appropriate resources are not available in the timeframe required.  Making action even more difficult is the fact that organizations do not have internal cybersecurity capability and must find and hire conslultants at the time of attack.

# Background

Technology has changed the way we fight and those that master the new technologies get the edge in the battlespace.

## French Revolution

>Commanders had to work out their approach to battle and organize their forces accordingly. What van Creveld had in mind was a step change that occurred around this time. Before 1800, intelligence-gathering and communication systems were slow and unreliable. For that reason, generals had to be on the front line—or at least not too far behind—in order to adjust quickly to the changing fortunes of battle. They dared not develop plans of any complexity. Adopting measures such as splitting forces in order to attack the enemy from different directions or holding back reserves to reinforce success was likely to lead to command and logistical nightmares. Roads were poor and movement was bound to be slow. Although it was no longer necessary to live off the land, logistical support required that magazines be moved along supply lines. This entailed a serious vulnerability if the enemy managed to cut the lines. Modest maneuvers or nighttime marches were the best options for catching an enemy by surprise. Armies that lacked passion and commitment, whose soldiers were easily tempted to desert if food was in short supply or conditions too harsh, did not encourage confidence in sustainable campaigns. Prudence suggested concentrating on pushing enemies into positions where they would feel vulnerable or struggle to stay supplied. All this limited the impact of wars on the apparently stable European balance of power. Then, as transport systems were improving and lands were becoming properly mapped, along came Napoleon Bonaparte, self-proclaimed emperor of France. Napoleon embodied a new way of fighting wars: a combination of individual genius and mass organization, and objectives far more ambitious than those of his predecessors.

>The French Revolution of 1789 was a source of great energy, innovation, and destruction. It unleashed political and social forces that could not be contained in their time and whose repercussions continued to be felt in the succeeding centuries. In military affairs, the Revolution led to large, popular armies whose impact was enhanced by the developing means of transporting them over long distances. There was a move away from limited wars of position, bound up with quarrels between individual rulers and shaped by logistical constraints and unreliable armies, to total wars engaging whole nations.2 With Napoleon, wars became means by which one state could challenge the very existence of another. No longer were they an elaborate form of bargaining. The high stakes removed incentives to compromise and encouraged a fight to a bloody conclusion. Military maneuvers were no longer ritualistic—their impact reinforced by the occasional battle—but preludes to great confrontations that could see whole armies effectively eliminated and states subjugated.

## Civil War 

> Grant was the greatest general of the war, one who would have excelled at any time in any army. He understood the war in its entirety and quickly grasped how modern methods of communication, particularly the telegraph and the railroads, had endowed the commander with the power to collect information more quickly and the means to disseminate appropriate orders in response.
